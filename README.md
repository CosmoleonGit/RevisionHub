A program I made to help with revision. Here is a generalized list of all of its features:

- An explorer for creating, modifying, moving and deleting files and folders.

- Flashcards - collections of cards with information on both sides for testing yourself and learning information.

- Tests - sets of questions which can either be typed or multiple choice.

- Documents - RTF text which can store large amounts of information for revision.

- A notepad for jotting down information.

- A timer and a stopwatch.

- Alerts - Allows you to create reminders for certain times at certain dates.

- Themes - Allows you to make your own colour schemes for the app.

- Pack downloads - Allows you to download folders containing revision material from this repository.
