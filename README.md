I made this program as a tool for myself and some of my friends do revision for exams and subjects as a whole.

This project helped me drastically improve my abilities in C# aswell and is when I began to use GitHub.

While I will update this a little in the future I will stray away from WinForms from now on and focus on WPF and UWP for desktop applications instead.

Here is a generalized list of all of its features:

- An explorer for creating, modifying, moving and deleting files and folders.

- Flashcards - collections of cards with information on both sides for testing yourself and learning information.

- Tests - sets of questions which can either be typed or multiple choice.

- Documents - RTF text which can store large amounts of information for revision.

- A notepad for jotting down information.

- A timer and a stopwatch.

- Alerts - Allows you to create reminders for certain times at certain dates.

- Themes - Allows you to make your own colour schemes for the app.

- Pack downloads - Allows you to download folders containing revision material from this repository.
